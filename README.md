#BlackJack Project
#Description
- this game implements the four pillars of Object Oriented programming 
Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation. 
- This game utilizes several classes one for a card, a deck, a player, a dealer etc...
- This is a black jack game and the usual rules apply so have fun.
If you go over 21 you bust, if you're 21 or under and dealer busts you win, if you get the same score as the dealer its a push, if don't bust but dealer has higher cards and also has not busted you lose and vice versa.
- Implementing soft and hard aces since an ace can be a 1 or 11 was challenging but worthwhile for game coherence.
